                        <div class="content-text">A few years ago I gave a flash talk about an earlier version of my dissertation at Grad Slam, a yearly event at UCLA where grad students give 3-minute talks about their research. My presentation was ranked amongst the 10 best of the 50 presentations that were submitted that year. The subject of my dissertation has since shifted (and now focuses solely on anesthesia). I have spun out the topics I discuss in this video into an article that has received a revise and resubmit from <cite>Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences</cite>.</div>
